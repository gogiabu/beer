<p style="color:goldenrod"><b>Beer is one of the oldest types of alcoholic drinks in the world, and the most widely consumed. It is the third most popular drink overall after potable water and tea. It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsâ€”most commonly malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used.</b></p>
